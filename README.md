# Movie-Recommender-Model-
Welcome to the Movie Recommender System!!!  This repository contains a movie recommender model built using a dataset from Kaggle. The project is implemented in Python, utilizing popular libraries such as pandas, numpy, and scikit-learn. The recommender system predicts and suggests movies to users based on their past interactions with movies.
## Overview
This project is a fun exploration into the world of personalized movie recommendations. Using a dataset from Kaggle, I’ve built a system that suggests movies you might like based on your past movies, viewing habits and preferences.
## What’s Inside
### This project includes:

Content-Based Filtering: Suggests movies that are similar to the ones you’ve enjoyed before.
## Tools & Libraries
#### Here’s what I used to bring this project to life:

Python: The core programming language.

Jupyter Notebook: For coding and experimenting.

Pandas: To handle and explore the data.

Numpy: For all the number crunching.

Scikit-learn: To build and evaluate the models.

## Installation
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1: Clone the repository:
 ```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Movie-Recommender-Model-.git
 ```
2: Navigate to the project folder:
``` bash
cd Movie-Recommender-Model-
```
3: Install the necessary libraries:
``` bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn
```
## Usage
1: Download the Dataset: Make sure you have the Kaggle dataset file [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata) in the same directory as the notebook.

2: Launch Jupyter Notebook:
``` bash
jupyter notebook
```
3: Open the Notebook: Navigate to Movie_Recommender_Model.ipynb in Jupyter
