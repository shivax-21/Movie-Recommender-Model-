# Movie-Recommender-Model-
Welcome to the Movie Recommender System!!!  This repository contains a movie recommender model built using a dataset from Kaggle. The project is implemented in Python, utilizing popular libraries such as pandas, numpy, and scikit-learn. The recommender system predicts and suggests movies to users based on their past interactions with movies.
## Overview
This project is a fun exploration into the world of personalized movie recommendations. Using a dataset from Kaggle, I’ve built a system that suggests movies you might like based on your past movies, viewing habits and preferences.
## What’s Inside
### This project includes:
Content-Based Filtering: Suggests movies that are similar to the ones you’ve enjoyed before.
## Tools & Libraries
#### Here’s what I used to bring this project to life:
* Python: The core programming language.
* Jupyter Notebook: For coding and experimenting.
* Pandas: To handle and explore the data.
* Numpy: For all the number crunching.
* Scikit-learn: To build and evaluate the models.

## Installation
To run this project locally, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository:
 ```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Movie-Recommender-Model-.git
 ```
2. Navigate to the project folder:
``` bash
cd Movie-Recommender-Model-
```
3. Install the necessary libraries:
``` bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn
```
## Usage
1. Download the Dataset: Make sure you have the Kaggle dataset file [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata) in the same directory as the notebook.

2. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
``` bash
jupyter notebook
```
3. Open the Notebook: Navigate to `Movie_Recommender.ipynb` in Jupyter.
4. Run the Cells: Execute the cells in the notebook to train the model and see movie recommendations.
## Results
This recommender system will help you discover new movies based on what you and others like. The model’s performance is evaluated to ensure that it provides meaningful and accurate recommendations.
## Contributing
I’d love to see your contributions! Feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request if you have suggestions or improvements.
