# Movie-Recommender-Model-
Welcome to the Movie Recommender System!!!  This repository contains a movie recommender model built using a dataset from Kaggle. The project is implemented in Python, utilizing popular libraries such as pandas, numpy, and scikit-learn. The recommender system predicts and suggests movies to users based on their past interactions with movies.
## Overview
This project is a fun exploration into the world of personalized movie recommendations. Using a dataset from Kaggle, I’ve built a system that suggests movies you might like based on your past movies, viewing habits and preferences.
## What’s Inside
### This project includes:

Content-Based Filtering: Suggests movies that are similar to the ones you’ve enjoyed before.
## Tools & Libraries
#### Here’s what I used to bring this project to life:

Python: The core programming language.

Jupyter Notebook: For coding and experimenting.

Pandas: To handle and explore the data.

Numpy: For all the number crunching.

Scikit-learn: To build and evaluate the models.
